      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I've been suffering with pain on my right ankles posterial tibial tendon, I've stopped running for just under a month now and contacted my GP the other day. The advice was pretty useless I was told to just rest and take ibrofrufen. Going to phone back in a week or 2 if I'm still having problems.<br />
<br />
While the forum is still active I thought I'd ask could this affect my medical at all? I'm fairly worried as I don't want this to get in the way of achieving my goal.<br />

Any help on the subject and/or...<br />

But I've also been to the physio about plantar fasciitis, achilles tendonitis, which I have all fully recovered from.

<br />
I'll try to keep it brief, I was NFA'd late last year (November time) due to shin splints (I stupidly picked them up before entering training), they were minor, fractures ruled out with X-Ray, early on in training made this decision to bring it to the attention of the medical staff as I didn't want to ruin my chances by breaking a leg a couple months down the line. Anyway, was told to do a 3 month exercise diary, re-do the medical, peak flow diary etc, did it and passed them all...<br />

I’ve passed my medical before Christmas.<br />

does anyone know when the next RROP is coming up for RMR Mersey? After my medical is finally signed off all I have to do is my VPJFT but I’m getting a bit nervous I’m running out of time.</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hi all<br />
Just wondering what the difference is between basic and professional training is for RM officers. On the Navy website it isn't particularly specific and does not explain what the specific differences are. The differences seem fairly self explanatory, but just wondering what the specific details are.</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hi, I'm looking at RM officers and I was wondering when the cut off date is for applications. I still quite a way off as I'm only 16 and I'm also looking at other options but as I'm born in June would I miss the cut-off date for POC as I'd be too young. Also is the deadline date static or does it vary year to year?</div>]]></content:encoded>
